# Lung Cancer Prediction using Ensemble Methods

## Abstract

This project introduces a novel ensemble method aimed at improving the precision of lung cancer predictions. By combining the strengths of the Naive Bayes and Random Forest algorithms, our approach addresses the limitations inherent in each algorithm when utilized independently. The core of our method lies in integrating Random Forest’s robust feature selection capabilities with Naive Bayes’ expertise in probabilistic predictions.

Initially, Random Forest assesses and ranks the relevance of features within a comprehensive dataset of 24 attributes associated with lung cancer, identifying the most crucial disease indicators. Subsequently, the Naive Bayes classifier utilizes these key features to construct a probability matrix, leading to a significant enhancement in lung cancer prediction accuracy.

Our in-depth analysis of the dataset underscores the effectiveness and superiority of our hybrid technique in healthcare prediction. Particularly noteworthy is the marked improvement in predictive accuracy achieved through our combined approach compared to using each algorithm independently. By amalgamating feature selection with probabilistic modeling, we substantially augment the accuracy of lung cancer detection, potentially facilitating earlier diagnoses and better treatment outcomes.

Beyond its immediate impact on lung cancer prediction, our research has broader implications for healthcare and beyond. Implementing our hybrid method could revolutionize diagnostic workflows, equipping healthcare providers with a potent tool to enhance patient outcomes. Moreover, our project offers valuable insights into ensemble learning methodologies, laying the groundwork for future advancements in predictive analytics and machine learning.

Looking ahead, our project represents a crucial step towards more accurate and efficient methods for disease prediction and healthcare decision-making.
